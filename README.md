QCLAB++ is an object-oriented, fully templated C++ package for creating and
representing quantum circuits. QCLAB++ can be used for rapid prototyping and
testing of quantum algorithms, and allows for fast algorithm development and
discovery. QCLAB++ provides I/O through openQASM making it compatible with
quantum hardware.


## How to run?

The QCLAB++ package uses the CMake build system (CMake version â‰¥ 3.16).
The recommended way of building QCLAB++ is as follows:

1. Install

        git clone https://github.com/QuantumComputingLab/qclabpp.git

2. CMake

        cd qclabpp
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ..
        make -j8

3. Run tests

        ./test/qclab_tests

4. Generate documentation

        doxygen doxygen.dox
