/*! \mainpage Overview

QCLAB++ is an object-oriented, fully templated C++ package for creating and
representing quantum circuits. QCLAB++ can be used for rapid prototyping and
testing of quantum algorithms, and allows for fast algorithm development and
discovery. QCLAB++ provides I/O through openQASM making it compatible with
quantum hardware.


## How to run?

The QCLAB++ package uses the CMake build system (CMake version â‰¥ 3.16).
The recommended way of building the QCLAB++ library is as follows:

1.      Install
        \code {.bash}
        git clone https://github.com/QuantumComputingLab/qclabpp.git
        \endcode

2.      CMake
        \code {.bash}
        cd qclabpp
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ..
        make -j8
        \endcode

3.      Run tests
        \code {.bash}
        ./test/qclab_tests
        \endcode

4.      Generate documentation
        \code {.bash}
        doxygen doxygen.dox
        \endcode


## How to run on Perlmutter?

1.      Install
        \code {.bash}
        git clone https://github.com/QuantumComputingLab/qclabpp.git
        \endcode

2.      CMake
        \code {.bash}
        module swap PrgEnv-[...] PrgEnv-nvidia
        module load cmake
        cd qclabpp
        cmake -H. -Brelease_nvc -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=cc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=CC -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fast -mp=gpu -gpu=cc80" -DQCLAB_OMP_OFFLOADING=ON
        cd release_nvc
        make -j8
        \endcode

3.      Run tests
        \code {.bash}
        ./test/qclab_tests
        \endcode
